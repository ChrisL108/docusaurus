# {% company-name /%}

You are a content provider and you are looking for a video solution.  {% company-name /%} can be that solution.  You won’t need to worry about your content being on someone else's servers, you want your customers on your infrastructure so you are in charge of every aspect of the experience.  Do you want your own custom chat features?  Our platform allows your team can build it.  {% company-name /%} only handles the streaming part leaving you in charge of everything else.  Think of a typical sporting event that is broadcast on television.  Multiple cameras are getting data, but a producer or director in the booth chooses what the fans see on their screens.  But what if it didn't have to be that way?  With {% company-name /%} you can make all of those streams available to your users. 

## What Video Offers

The {% company-name /%} platform is your turnkey solution to make your site stand out. You can broadcast on the web, build native applications on mobile, and customize how your streams get to your users. All of these features help drive engagement.,

## Engagement

Engagement is a key reason to turn to {% company-name /%}. You want your customers to talk about your streams and to be an advocate to draw additional fans to your event. {% company-name /%} helps you do that by making sure there is as low latency to the video as possible. Your teams can integrate chat features, games, polls, and other interactive features that will all be synched up to the action on the stream. You won’t have to worry about customers being behind on the action or getting spoiled by something because one viewer in the chat room is ahead of all the rest.

## Authorization

Another differentiating feature for {% company-name /%} is how we handle authorization and authentication. Typically with a streaming service, your user is issued a token and they can stream the video as long as their token is valid. The downside to this _push_ setup is that glitches can prevent the service from revoking a token (when the user is no longer paying for the stream). The alternative to a _push_ system is a _pull_ system. With a _pull_ system, you validate every video served to the customer.

With {% company-name /%} you bring your own infrastructure (CDN and storage systems) and then integrate our services to deliver engaging content to your customers and fans. You pick the way you are taking in video content (ingress) - either WebRTC or RTMP. Then you pick how viewers see the content (egress) - either HLS or RTC. Finally, you get to choose the options about Codecs, transcoding options, latency, and other settings. Your {% company-name /%} Engagement Manager will interview you about your use case and help you configure the settings for an optimal viewing experience.
