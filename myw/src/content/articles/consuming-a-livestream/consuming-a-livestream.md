Unlike most streaming platforms, our SDK provides an all-in-one player that accommodates all formats the streaming platform is capable of delivering. This allows the operator to configure what formats streams are available to specified users and provides the capability for graceful degradation of features for a wide range of devices. The player is delivered a manifest containing all options and makes appropriate decisions with regard to format and automatic quality switching based on support and configuration.
