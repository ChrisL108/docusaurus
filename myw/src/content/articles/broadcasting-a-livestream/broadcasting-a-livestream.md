Our streaming platform provides third-party users the ability to send audio and video streams at their leisure and the integration tools required to process the stream and distribute it to authorized viewers. These streams can come from professional or semi-professional software like OBS or Wirecast for highly produced events, from a mobile device, or from the browser for a turnkey solution accessible to anyone with an internet connection. These three primary streaming methods have their trade-offs but can be used simultaneously by different users within the same stream network.
