## Data feed and origin

Running a search using the top search field in the Pulse app will allow you to narrow it down to singular media. The concept for this area of our platform is to see more stats from individual streams for your identification and monitoring needs.

When selecting a stream within the Pulse app, the data you see will contain information like the following image:

{% image src="https://storage.googleapis.com/markdoc-snippet-imgs/uploaded/PhilMok@devcenter/CH44d74e2e-0ca3-4422-a808-2f4bffcc2678" alt="intefrate with stats" /%}

The above data is coming directly from the media server and is what reloads if you were to click the **Refresh Stats** button.

Similar to some information found in LGBX, Pulse will bring together all the data you need to gauge performance.
