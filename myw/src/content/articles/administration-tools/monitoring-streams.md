## Locating a stream

In Pulse, search by using the top field to enter a Public Key, Private key, or Slug.

By default, a Region and Host may already be selected, showing Public Keys for any streams available below. You can click on any one of these Public Keys to open up more information about the stream. If you have Pools setup, you can select the desired Pool for your Region.

**Show Playback** (checkbox) will allow you to immediately view the streamâ€™s video once you click on the Public Key. Unchecking this box will hide the player and does not run playback when you select a stream.

## Viewing stream stats

There are a number of data points available based on Video and Audio specs for each stream. With default page settings (Show Playback checkbox enabled), as you click on a Public Key or Stream, you will see data tags with initial video information. You can click the **Refresh Stats** button to reload the latest specifics for the streaming content.

Further down the page will contain multiple graphs and even more live data about the currently selected stream. If you mouse-hover over any of the graphs showing data, you will be able to get specific details to help you get a bearing on the scale of the graph, or what values are considered an increase or decrease.
