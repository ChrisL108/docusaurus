## Pulse app  (cont’d)

The stability of groups or individual streams can depend heavily on many factors, like SFU proximity, hardware, or network. When utilizing Pulse, you can access the sets of details necessary to watch for inconsistencies. 

## Finding your “Base-line”

Depending on your business needs, your average streaming stats, or what you come to learn later as “normal” stream/server performance, can vary. A good way to discover stream expectations is to early adopt the monitoring of such streams. Each stream can have different effects on machines, and a particular way is to watch CPU usage.  Additionally, when you start to notice things like Bitrate and Video Dimensions are staying around the same range, it can apply to what should be a good starting point for your expected normal operation.

## Comparing streams

If you have a certain user or region of users that you have noticed are very reliable, running healthy, and stable, you may want to save their account (or instance) for testing later. If in the event you have to investigate a streaming issue, you may be able to use this user/account/streamer as a side-by-side comparison. Look at what stats are different between them, as well as compare them with your operational averages (as mentioned in the previous section).
