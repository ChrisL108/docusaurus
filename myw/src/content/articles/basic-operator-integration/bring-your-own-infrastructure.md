To deliver the most value out of the streaming platform for our customers, we give operators the ability to pick and choose the infrastructure that works for them. There are myriads of excellent CDNs and storage services, so instead of tying you to a specific partner, we want to provide you with the ability to choose the solution that works for you.
 
For CDNs, talk to your engagement manager to get recommendations on one that fits your budget and requirements.
 
For archiving storage, we integrate with the following APIs:
- AWS Cloud Storage
- Any S3 compatible API
- Google Cloud Storage
 
For streaming platform-related hardware, we offer full-service management and optimization of Google Cloud offerings.
